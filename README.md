Numerical analysis program
==========================

Just to build some programs for checking the computational result after I did my classwork for MATH3312.

The repo is built to make a copy only. Shit codes everywhere in the repo, I will try to optimize it when I am free and I am excited on it, haha.

Topics covered in this repo:

-	Bisection method (bisection.py)

-	False position - Fixed point iteration (fixed.py)

-	Newton method (newton.py)

-	Secant method (secant.py)

-	Lagrange polynomial (lagrangegen.py -> lagrange.py)

-	Divided difference (dividediff.py)

-	Forward/backward Divided difference (forwarddiff.py)

-	Trapezoidal / Simpson / Midpoint rule to have numerical differentiation

-	Euler method for odes (euler.py)

-	Gaussian elimination (gaussian.py)

-	Partial pivoting (pivot.py)

-	LU Decomposition (LUFactor.py)

e.py is used to provide different parameters, a bit messy here. Use python2 to run the py files above Gaussian elimination on the topic list above. Python3 for Gaussian elimination or below.
